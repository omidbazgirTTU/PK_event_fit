# Neural ODE Framework Comparison

**A comprehensive comparison of JAX/Diffrax, TorchDiffEq, and TorchDyn for pharmacokinetic modeling**

## Executive Summary

This post presents a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison of three popular Neural ODE frameworks applied to pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling with discontinuous dosing events. We evaluate:

- **JAX/Diffrax**: Functional programming with JIT compilation
- **TorchDiffEq**: Classic PyTorch ODE solver
- **TorchDyn**: Modern PyTorch Neural ODE library

**Key Findings:**

- **Fastest Training**: JAX/Diffrax (~30-40s for 2000 iterations)
- **Most Memory Efficient**: JAX/Diffrax (~250 MB peak)
- **Best Stability**: All frameworks show excellent stability (<1% overshoot at dosing events)
- **Most Accurate**: All frameworks achieve similar accuracy (RMSE < 0.05)

---

## Methodology

### Problem Setup

We model a **two-compartment pharmacokinetic system** with piecewise dosing:

- **Compartments**: Central (blood/plasma) and Peripheral (tissue)
- **Dosing**: 100 mg bolus at t = [12, 24, 36] hours
- **Integration window**: 0-48 hours
- **Data**: 100 samples with varying PK parameters

### Standardized Architecture

All three implementations use **identical configurations**:

```python
# Network architecture
layer_sizes = [2, 64, 64, 2]  # Input: [A1, A2] → Output: [dA1/dt, dA2/dt]
activation = ReLU

# Training configuration
optimizer = Adam(lr=1e-3)
iterations = 2000
loss = MSE

# Solver configuration
solver = Dopri5/Tsit5  # 5th-order adaptive Runge-Kutta
atol = 1e-7
rtol = 1e-5
```

### Evaluation Metrics

We measure four key dimensions:

1. **Computational Performance**
   - Training time (total and per iteration)
   - Memory usage (peak and average)

2. **Numerical Stability**
   - Post-dose overshoot percentage
   - Oscillation amplitude
   - Noise level (second-derivative variance)

3. **Accuracy**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

4. **Reproducibility**
   - Consistency across multiple runs
   - Variance in key metrics

## Results

### Performance Comparison

*Figure 1: Training time comparison across frameworks (2000 iterations, mean ± std over 3 runs)*

#### Performance Metrics Table

| Framework | Training Time (s) | Time/Iter (ms) | Peak Memory (MB) | RMSE |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------|------|
| JAX/Diffrax | 35.2 ± 2.1 | 17.6 | 245 | 0.0351 |
| TorchDiffEq | 72.8 ± 3.5 | 36.4 | 487 | 0.0349 |
| TorchDyn | 58.4 ± 2.9 | 29.2 | 412 | 0.0353 |

### Stability at Dosing Events

A critical test for Neural ODE solvers is handling **discontinuous events**. When a dose is administered, the concentration jumps instantaneously, creating a challenging scenario for adaptive solvers.

*Figure 3: Side-by-side comparison of framework behavior at dosing event (t=12h)*

#### Stability Metrics Table

| Metric | JAX/Diffrax | TorchDiffEq | TorchDyn |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Mean Overshoot (%) | 0.35 | 0.42 | 0.38 |
| Max Overshoot (%) | 0.58 | 0.71 | 0.63 |
| Mean Oscillation Amplitude | 0.0023 | 0.0031 | 0.0027 |
| Mean Time to Peak (h) | 0.012 | 0.015 | 0.013 |
| Consistency Score | 0.95 | 0.92 | 0.94 |

**Key Observations:**

- **Overshoot**: All frameworks exhibit minimal overshoot (<1%), indicating good numerical stability
- **Oscillations**: Post-dose oscillations are well-controlled across all implementations
- **Consistency**: JAX shows slightly better consistency due to JIT-compiled solver

## Deep Dive: Stability at Dosing Events

Dosing events introduce **discontinuities** that challenge numerical solvers. When a bolus dose is administered, the concentration in the central compartment jumps instantaneously, but the ODE solver must handle this smoothly.

### What We Measure

1. **Jump Size**: Magnitude of concentration increase
2. **Overshoot**: Percentage by which solver overshoots the true peak
3. **Oscillations**: Post-dose numerical artifacts
4. **Time to Peak**: How quickly solver resolves the peak
5. **Noise Level**: High-frequency numerical noise

### Comparative Analysis

All three frameworks handle the discontinuity well, but with subtle differences:

- **JAX/Diffrax**: Smoothest trajectory with minimal oscillation
- **TorchDiffEq**: Slightly more conservative (smaller time steps near discontinuity)
- **TorchDyn**: Good balance, benefits from adjoint method for gradient stability

## Reproducibility

All experiments are fully reproducible:

- **Fixed random seeds**: 42 for all frameworks
- **Identical data**: Same `pk_dataset_2C.npz` file
- **Same architecture**: [2→64→64→2] with ReLU
- **Same hyperparameters**: Adam, lr=1e-3, 2000 iterations

Results may vary slightly due to hardware and floating-point precision, but overall trends should be consistent.
